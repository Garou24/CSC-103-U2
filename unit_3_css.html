	What is Puppet? And why should you consider it for your cloud and servers?
	</div>
	<div>
	Puppet can define infrastructure as code, manage multiple servers, and enforce system configuration. And oh, so much more.

	Puppet is one of the great DevOps programs for managing multiple servers.
Once upon a time, we system administrators used shell scripts to run our servers. We still use themâ€”but the method doesn't scale. Even the best sys admin is too busy to constantly modify scripts for hundreds or thousands of ever-changing servers and their system configurations.
DevOps applications can solve this problem by automating server setup, program installation, and system management. One of the most important of these programs is Puppet.
Puppet, along with Chef, are the most popular DevOps programs, according to RightScale's 2016 survey of DevOps trends. Puppet is used by 42 percent of businesses that use DevOps methodologies, followed closely by Chef with 37 percent.
Puppet is an open source software configuration management and deployment tool. It's most commonly used on Linux and Windows to pull the strings on multiple application servers at once. But you can also use Puppet on several platforms, including IBM mainframes, Cisco switches, and Mac OS servers.
Like other DevOps programs, Puppet does more than automate system administration. It changes the human workflow, and enables developers and system administrators to work together. Programmers can write, test, and launch applications without waiting on Ops staff to deliver the resources needed.
For example, Microsoft and Puppet recently partnered with the RISCO Group, an Israeli security project company, to create a Puppet and Azure Resource Manager-powered self-service web portal. The result, says Ido Vapner, RISCO Group's head of DevSecOps and technology, is a development workflow that enables the company to "provision an entire environment with a single click" instead of it taking "a week to build a new environment."
"The entire project helps us by saving over 200 hours per month," Vapner says.
